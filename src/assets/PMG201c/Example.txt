Request 1:
- Project Sponsor
+ Impact: Provides funding and approves major decisions. 
+ Strategy to Manage: Keep them regularly updated with reports; involve them in key milestone reviews.
- Development Team 
+ Impact: Builds the platform features (registration, payment integration, etc.). 
+ Strategy to Manage: Daily standups and sprint demos; remove blockers quickly.
- Vendors 
+ Impact: Will use the platform to sell products; their adoption is critical. 
+ Strategy to Manage: Gather feedback early; offer beta-testing opportunities.
- Payment Providers 
+ Impact: Need to be integrated smoothly for successful transactions. 
+ Strategy to Manage: Constant communication; early technical alignment sessions.

Request 2:
- Payment gateway integration delays
+ Possibility: Medium
+ Impact: High
+ Mitigation Strategy: Early technical meetings with providers; mock testing.
- Platform scalability issues (e.g. traffic spikes)
+ Possibility: High
+ Impact: High
+ Mitigation Strategy: Load testing early; use scalable cloud infrastructure.
- Poor vendor adoption
+ Possibility: Medium
+ Impact: High
+ Mitigation Strategy: Vendor onboarding campaigns; simple UX/UI design.
- Security breach (due to many transactions)
+ Possibility: Low
+ Impact: Very High
+ Mitigation Strategy: Penetration testing; implement strong encryption standards.

a, 
Start -> A -> D -> E -> End
Start -> A -> D -> G -> End
Start -> B -> F -> G -> End
Start -> C -> H -> I -> End
b, 
Start -> A -> D -> E -> End = 17 days
Start -> A -> D -> G -> End = 15 days
Start -> B -> F -> G -> End = 12 days
Start -> C -> H -> I -> End = 14 days
So that, Minimum project duration = 17 days and Critical Path = Start -> A -> D -> E -> End
c,  Activities with the most flexibility is: Activities B, F, C, H, and I. Because their paths are shorter than the critical path and have slack.
d, There are four solutions to speed up the project:
- Fast-tracking: Start activity E or G in parallel with D if possible (overlapping work, but it increases risk).
- Crashing: Add extra resources to D (example: more developers or support) to finish it faster — but this may cost more.
- Reduce scope (de-scope): Drop some non-critical features (maybe minor vendor customization) to save time — must get sponsor approval.
- Overtime/Extra Shifts: Ask the team to work extra hours temporarily to recover time (only if morale and budget allow).

Request 4:
We have: 
- EV (Earned Value) = $300,000
- AC (Actual Cost) = $400,000
- PV (Planned Value) = $500,000
From which, we can calculate:
- CPI (Cost Performance Index) = EV / AC = 300,000 / 400,000 = 0.75
- SPI (Schedule Performance Index) = EV / PV = 300,000 / 500,000 = 0.6
With the above results:
- CPI = 0.75 -> Cost efficiency is poor (you're only getting $0.75 value for every $1 spent).
- SPI = 0.6 -> Project is way behind schedule (only 60% progress compared to plan).
Forecast to complete:
- BAC (Budget at Completion) = $800,000
- EAC (Estimate at Completion) = BAC / CPI = 800,000 ÷ 0.75 = $1,066,667
=> We will spend $1,066,667 instead of $800,000.
Time to complete:
- Originally 6 months planned.
- SPI = 0.6 means it will take about 1 / 0.6 x 6 = 1.67 x 6 ≈ 10 months
=> Estimated project duration ≈ 10 months
Summary about current situation:
- Cost: Over budget (CPI < 1)
- Schedule: Severely delayed (SPI < 1)
- Action needed: Rebaseline schedule, add resources, reduce scope, or fast-track some work.
